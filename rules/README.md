1. **Set in Environment Variables**: In your backend `.env` file, set:
   ```env
   ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE=your_secure_admin_code_here
   ```
2. **Choose a Secure Code**: Use a strong, unique code (recommended: 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. **System Administrator**: Contact the system administrator who deployed the application

**Option 3: Check Current Code (If you have backend access)**
1. Check the `.env` file in the backend folder
2. Look for `ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE=your_code`
3. If not set, the default code `admin123` is used

**Security Note**: 
- Never share the admin registration code publicly
- Change the default code before deploying to production
- Use a strong, unique code for security
